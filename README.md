# style-guides

The goal of style-guides is to set guide lines for how to write consistent code across digITs services. The already big importance of a style guide is magnified due to digITs board changing every year. For new digITs to be able to keep up and find out how eariler boards of digIT wrote code, they should be able to find these style guides as a good starting point.
